STACSHACK 2022 Project
======================

This was a project I programmed for the STACSHACK 2022 hackathon. The theme was murder mysteries and we had 24 hours to program something.

I worked on this program indivually and was fortunate enough to win the best solo project prize with it.

More information about the design of the program and the hackathon can be found at https://devpost.com/software/escape-artist-a7usfw.

Premise
=======

This program was designed to be like a mini game. The objective was to navigate from one city to another within the UK, however you can only move to nearby cities. The program was named Escaper to allude to the murder mystery theme, as you are acting as a murder escaping across the UK.

A European map was also included in the final product in the hackathon.

Further Development
===================

Many people recommended I continue with this project and I do still feel I can improve it further. So I will be developing it on a seperate branch.
Among other things, I plan to create an online version of this to make it more accessible for others to play

Running the Program
===================

To run the program you can download the release zip and run the jar within the same directory.
You can use the command java -jar Escaper.jar, assuming you have Java 11 or higher already installed.

PS. Because I was rushing near the end, and wanted to make sure people could run it, this jar is also included in the original source ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
